<h1>The Best Movies by Karla</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Sound of Freedom</h3>
<p>This movie is based on a real life story that took place in Colombia.</p> 
<p>I would give this movie a 8/10. A very touching movie that brings awareness.</p> 
<h3>2. The Notebook</h3>
<p>This movie is one of the best romantic movies out there. It tells the story of how a couple went through different problems and at the end they're still together.</p>
<p>However, the main character in this movie gets sick and can't remember her wife.</p>
<h3>3. The Wolf</h3>
<p>Lastly, The Wolf is one of the best movies out there. Tells how a wolf attacks someone and the person has to survive in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>At the end, he is rescued by a woman that was just passing by and got to hear him screaming.</p>
